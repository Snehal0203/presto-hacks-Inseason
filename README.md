# Signlingo

**We were inspired by the classical music track, so we wanted to create a project that honored one of our favorite classical composers, Antonio Vivaldi. Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" is one of his most iconic pieces, so we decided to create a project that used a seasonal theme.

As musicians ourselves, we also wanted to design our application to tackle real challenges that musicians face when practicing their instruments. Accordingly, our goal with In Season is to improve a musician's practice productivity, while playing tribute to Vivaldi!**

## What it does ✨ 

**In Season** allows the user to register an account and log in under that account every time you practice. Once logged in, you can access your practice page. The practice page includes different tools to aid you with your practice:

- A posture checker, for gradually improving posture
- A timer, for keeping track of practice times
- A virtual piano, for seamless tuning
- A note taker, for keeping track of practice goals

All of these features are super simple for the user and are easy to navigate. Because of this, the user can have the maximum practice efficiency with the minimum amount of stress.

**In Season** stands out from traditional music apps because of this wide variety of features. Moreover, **In Season’s** timer includes a tree that changes its foliage every quarter of an hour. This acts as an unconventional visual progress tracker while staying true to the Vivaldi theme.
